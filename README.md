# Expo CLI Build Error: Missing or Misconfigured Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Expo apps that rely on native modules.  The error often arises from an improperly configured development environment or missing dependencies required for building Android and/or iOS projects.

## Problem Description:

The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a native module is used, but the necessary environment setup (Android Studio, Xcode, SDKs, etc.) is incomplete or incorrect.  This leads to build failures when attempting to run the Expo app using the Expo CLI.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. This solution addresses the underlying problem of missing or misconfigured native module dependencies by ensuring that the required development environment components are properly set up, configured, and accessible to the Expo build process.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Try to run the app using `expo start` and then `expo run:android` or `expo run:ios` (depending on your target platform).
4. Observe the build errors in the terminal. Now examine `bugSolution.js` for the solution.

## Additional Notes:

* Ensure you have the correct Android SDK/NDK and Xcode installed and configured according to Expo's documentation.
* Double-check that all native module dependencies are correctly linked and configured in your project.
* Consult the Expo documentation for platform-specific troubleshooting guides and best practices.
