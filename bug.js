This error typically arises when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an app that depends on native modules or has native code, but the necessary build environment isn't correctly configured or accessible. It can manifest in various ways, including failures to build the Android or iOS project, issues with linking native libraries, or unexpected behavior during runtime.  The core problem is a mismatch or missing dependency between the Expo environment, the native modules used in the application, and the development environment setup (Android Studio, Xcode, etc.).
